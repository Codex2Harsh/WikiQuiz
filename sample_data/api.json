summary
: 
"An Application Programming Interface (API) is a software interface that allows communication and connection between different computer programs or systems, contrasting with a user interface which connects a computer to a person. APIs serve to abstract and hide the internal complexities of a system, exposing only necessary tools and services, and are fundamental for modern software development, ranging from web services to operating systems and hardware."
