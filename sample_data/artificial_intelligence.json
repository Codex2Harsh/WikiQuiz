summary
: 
"Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and decision-making. It is a field of research focused on developing methods that enable machines to perceive their environment and use intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals."
